-   Are we set up?

    -   GitHub accounts
    -   R and RStudio installed
    -   Git installed
    -   SSH keys set up

```{R}
# did I forget to tell y'all to install knitr? 
# or maybe it's default recently?
# install.packages("knitr")

library(knitr)

# sessionInfo() shows your R version and packages
# you'll see rmarkdown yaml and knitr in there
sessionInfo()

```

-   A little bit about Quarto
-   Collaboration with Github
    -   aka: contributing to Open Source projects
    -   aka: creating and resolving conflict
-   Red \| Green stickies

## Project Management

-   repo structure
-   ReadMe
-   Licenses
-   Quarto Notebooks

## Project Management

This presentation isn't exactly a notebook -- but the visual editor in rStudio is very notebook-like.

The code blocks execute when you 'render' the presentation. So what you see below is my working directory and a file list \* from the time the code was run \*

```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
list.files()
```

# Project Organization

# Slide again?

Visit #2 \# Quarto project structure

...these are inside of conflict-presentation_files/libs

![Everything in these 3 folders is autogenerated](images/guts.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the 3 folders that make the slides"}

<small>Dear Jon: switch over to rStudio and show your Learners what Source and Visual look like. You may want to un-comment the launch-a-project code on the next slide while you're over there. Because you're going to want to open the rAtlas</small>

# Example project

rAtlas of UCSB Campus

-   no qmd
-   runs straight through 2 paths
-   after maps are finished:
    -   format outputs into page pairs OR screen-output?

```{r}
# library(rstudioapi)
# openProject(selectFile())
```

# A little more about Quarto

-   We have a whole workshop
-   Helps you be FAIR and Open

# What should we do with visit 3?

Visit 2 will demonstrate some natural language processing (NLP)

-   Demo US Census API with non-US statistics?
-   Run through the rAtlas?
-   ...

# Hands-on challenge

-   Pair up help your neighbor
-   https://github.com/ucsb-dreamlab/r-comm-collaboration
    -   Player A: Fork my repo
    -   Player B: Clone Player A's fork of my repo
-   Make your suggestions above (starting at line xx (106) in the code)
-   Player B: commit and push your changes to your fork
    -   Create a Pull Request
-   Player A: Merge the Pull Request and view the updated presentation.

# Conflict resolution

If there is conflict:

\< it will look like this \> \>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> HEAD incomprehensible -gjk3980s- code Something that was inserted or duplicated by the pull. \>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>

# More on git

-   Much more: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice
-   git is NOT github
-   We are hosting a 6 hour workshop next week: https://carpentry.library.ucsb.edu/
